**#ICYDNCI What was the most popular, most clicked link, in [last week's newsletter](https://link)? [title](url).**

## Made with Mu

Why Mu? Mu tries to make it as easy as possible to get started with programming but aims to help you graduate to "real" development tools soon after. Everything in Mu is the "real thing" but presented in as simple and obvious way possible. It's like the toddling stage in learning to walk: you're finding your feet and once you're confident, you should move on and explore! Put simply, Mu aims to foster autonomy. Try out Mu today! - [codewith.mu](https://codewith.mu/)

## New Boards Supported by CircuitPython

The number of supported microcontrollers and Single Board Computers (SBC) grows every week. This section outlines which boards have been included in CircuitPython or added to [CircuitPython.org](https://circuitpython.org/).

This week we had X new boards added!

## CircuitPython Libraries!

[![CircuitPython Libraries](../assets/20200mdd/blinka.jpg)](https://circuitpython.org/libraries)

CircuitPython support for hardware continues to grow. We are adding support for new sensors and breakouts all the time, as well as improving on the drivers we already have. As we add more libraries and update current ones, you can keep up with all the changes right here!

For the latest libraries, download the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). For the latest community contributed libraries, download the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, CircuitPython libraries are a great place to start. Have an idea for a new driver? File an issue on [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/issues)! Have you written a library you'd like to make available? Submit it to the [CircuitPython Community Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle). Interested in helping with current libraries? Check out the [CircuitPython.org Contributing page](https://circuitpython.org/contributing). We've included open pull requests and issues from the libraries, and details about repo-level issues that need to be addressed. We have a guide on [contributing to CircuitPython with Git and Github](https://learn.adafruit.com/contribute-to-circuitpython-with-git-and-github) if you need help getting started. You can also find us in the #circuitpython channel on the [Adafruit Discord](https://adafru.it/discord).

You can check out this [list of all the Adafruit CircuitPython libraries and drivers available](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/blob/master/circuitpython_library_list.md). 

The current number of CircuitPython libraries is **###**!

**PyPI Download Stats!**

We've written a special library called Adafruit Blinka that makes it possible to use CircuitPython Libraries on [Raspberry Pi and other compatible single-board computers](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/). Adafruit Blinka and all the CircuitPython libraries have been deployed to PyPI for super simple installation on Linux! Here are the top 10 CircuitPython libraries downloaded from PyPI in the last week, including the total downloads for those libraries:

Keep checking back for updated download stats coming soon!

## Codecademy "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython"

[![Codecademy CircuitPython](../assets/20200mdd/codecademy_python.png)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter)

Codecademy, an online interactive learning platform used by more than 45 million people, has teamed up with the leading manufacturer in STEAM electronics, Adafruit Industries, to create a coding course, "Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython". The course is now available in the [Codecademy catalog](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter).

Python is a highly versatile, easy to learn programming language that a wide range of people, from visual effects artists in Hollywood to mission control at NASA, use to quickly solve problems. But you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to accomplish amazing things with it. This new course introduces programmers to Python by way of a microcontroller — CircuitPython — which is a Python-based programming language optimized for use on hardware.

CircuitPython’s hardware-ready design makes it easier than ever to program a variety of single-board computers, and this course gets you from no experience to working prototype faster than ever before. Codecademy’s interactive learning environment, combined with Adafruit's highly rated Circuit Playground Express, present aspiring hardware hackers with a never-before-seen opportunity to learn hardware programming seamlessly online.

Whether for those who are new to programming, or for those who want to expand their skill set to include physical computing, this course will have students getting familiar with Python and creating incredible projects along the way. By the end, students will have built their own bike lights, drum machine, and even a moisture detector that can tell when it's time to water a plant.

Visit Codecademy to access the [Learn Hardware Programming with CircuitPython](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-circuitpython?utm_source=adafruit&utm_medium=partners&utm_campaign=circuitplayground&utm_content=pythononhardwarenewsletter) course and Adafruit to purchase a [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

Codecademy has helped more than 45 million people around the world upgrade their careers with technology skills. The company’s online interactive learning platform is widely recognized for providing an accessible, flexible, and engaging experience for beginners and experienced programmers alike. Codecademy has raised a total of $43 million from investors including Union Square Ventures, Kleiner Perkins, Index Ventures, Thrive Capital, Naspers, Yuri Milner and Richard Branson, most recently raising its $30 million Series C in July 2016.
